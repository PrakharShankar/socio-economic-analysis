# Ink of progress : Navigating literacy rate's impact on indian bimaru states socio-economic dynamics.
This project is a comprehensive visual representation of how the change in literacy rates of the different states of india have affected the other socio-economic parameters.


## Overview

I have tried to visualize the growth of literacy rates for my model states and tried to correlate its growth with other socio-economic factors.

## Features

1. **Decadal growth rate of literacy for the four states : **
   - Visual representation of the growth of literacy rate for the four states over a gap of 10 years from 1951-2011.


2. **Literacy rate growth compared to population growth rate:**
   - Plotting the data for literacy rate growth and the population growth rate over the years for all the model state.

3. **Literacy growth rate compared to fertility rate :**
   - Plotting the data for literacy rate growth and the fertility changes over the years for all the model state.

4. **Literacy growth rate compared to sex ratio:**
   -  Plotting the data for literacy rate growth and the sex ratio changes over the years for all the model state.el.

5. **Literacy growth rate compared to life expectancy :**
   - Plotting the data for literacy rate growth and the life expectancy over the years for all the model state.

6. **Literacy growth rate compared to GDP growth rate :**
   - Plotting the data for literacy rate growth and the GDP growth rate over the years for all the model state.



## How to Use

Certainly, let me rephrase the instructions without code:

Step1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the provided URL.

Step2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - Change your current working directory to 'PythonProject'.

Step3. **Run the Project Script:**
   - Execute the 'projectproject.py' script and input the required information.

 **Modify Functions in module.py:**
   - If any changes to functions are necessary, make them in the 'module.py' script. Save the file, and the updates will be reflected in the main project when 'project.py' 
     is run again.

## Data Source

The project utilizes data from [https://data.gov.in/],  and [https://m.rbi.org.in/scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States] providing a reliable foundation for the statistics analysis.
I collected information from data.gov.in, which was released in 2020. However, I have supplemented this data with additional information from 2022 to provide the latest updates.
